# Web Developer Portfolio

### leroy.dev is my portfolio / ongoing project.

As a portfolio is some what a necessity, I use the opportunity to improve my skills and build upon what I learned from Dev Academy Aotearoa. Note that this is the type of project that one can constantly return to in order to update and improve upon.

- Refactor and refine existing code.
- Refactor for React.
- Create a database for blog posts.

#### Tech used so far:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
