![Cover Image](/images/cover-image.png)

## leroy.dev is a portfolio based ongoing project.

I improve my skills in responsive design. I build the website section-by-section using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Moreover we make our website completely responsive for any screen ratios. This is a on going project in which I come back to a add to features, refinements and stretch goals.

#### Wireframe: 
I design a wire frame in Figma making sure to it is responsive.

#### Responsive Design: 
Over all responsive design is not as simple as one may think. As some one that considers user experience it can be easy to miss fundamental design concepts. For example styling and layout decisions should be considered in the wireframing stage of your project in order to avoiding doubling back to fix potential mobile version errors. Note some seem to be unavoidable and only identified when building your responsive elements.

#### Responsive Mobile Navigation: 
The responsive navigation was a challenge to get correct but was definitely a value experience and i now feel confident in building responsive elements.

#### Animation: 
I created a animated image border, Note that this may not work in all browsers. The current browser is Google Chrome.

#### Hover State Image Scroll:
By adding a hover state this image will automatically scroll the full length of the webp image within in bounding box.
