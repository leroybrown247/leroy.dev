                    <p class="paragraph">I played a lead role in designing, styling, and developing the website. The project started with the initial design phase, for which we used Figma, a popular design tool.
                    In Figma, we created wireframes and mockups of each page, focusing on the overall layout, placement of elements, and visual aesthetics.</p>
                    
                    <p class="paragraph">This allowed us to establish a creative direction and ensure a cohesive look and feel across the website. We carefully considered the user experience, ensuring that the design was intuitive and user-friendly.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">During the development process, attention to detail was crucial. I ensured that the fonts, colors, spacing, and alignments matched the design specifications. This involved using CSS techniques such as flexbox and grid to create responsive and dynamic layouts.</p>
